Introduction to project

The Integrated System & Circuit Design 'ISCD' Master course's project has a duration of 3 semesters 
covers all aspects of the analog circuit design, full-custom layout, digital circuit design and 
implementation and lab evaluation of an integrated circuit.

It not only provides practical experience, but also soft skills like project planning, teamwork,
technical documentation and presentation skills.

The topic of the ISCD project is a dual-slope integrating Analog-to-Digital converter. The semesters 
session "Introduction to the Project" mainly covers the concept work and analog circuit design of
all nececcesay circuit blocks for the integrating ADC (IADC).


Team on board: 
Group 3 (Moh'd Abu Khalifa & Ram Ratnaker Reddy Bodha) was the group I worked with during the span 
of the project.
